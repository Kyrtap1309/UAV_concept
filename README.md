# UAV_concept

The project presents the process of constructing the aerodynamic body of an electronic warfare drone. I was inspired by the lack of engineering solutions found in Polish professional literature. In my work I used at least: Prandtl lift line theory by implementing it in Matlab and Inventor to model the aerodynamic body of the drone
